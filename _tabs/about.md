Having grown up in Anchorage, Alaska, I moved to England in my teenage years, and studied Mathematics at university in London before entering a career of teaching for 12 years.  I have taught at Sevenoaks School, Highgate School, North London Collegiate School, and Fulham Senior School.

I became facinated with the ever growing use of data systematically for innovation, decision making, predictions, and analysis.  I believe the advancement of the use of data has the potential to provide insight, but requires outstanding communication, and an ability to ensure that that which cannot be captured by data is still taken into consideration.

In 2022 I joined [LeWagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) to formally train as a Data Scientist.
